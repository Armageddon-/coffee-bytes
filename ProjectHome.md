Coffee-Bytes Platform Support is a suite of tools to help increase productivity when working in the Eclipse IDE, or when developing applications off of the Eclipse platform.

One of the features of Coffee-Bytes Platform Support that is fairly popular is the Eclipse Java Code Folding Support. This feature dramatically increases the flexibility and power of the code-folding in the Eclipse UI.

Note: This plug-in was previously hosted at Sourceforge, and has subsequently been moved to Google Code.
